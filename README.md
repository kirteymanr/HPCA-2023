# HPCA Programming Assignments

This repository contains solutions for **HPCA Programming Assignments** covering two main topics: **Branch Prediction and CPI Stack Analysis** (Assignment 01) and **Optimizing Performance of Dilated Convolution** (Assignment 02). Each assignment includes code implementations, performance analysis, and detailed reports documenting the results.

## Repository Structure

- **Assignment-01/**
  - Contains the code, report, and assignment document for **Branch Prediction and CPI Stack Analysis**.
  - This assignment involves evaluating branch predictors using the Champsim simulator and constructing CPI stacks using hardware performance counters.
  - See the `Assignment-01/README.md` for further details.

- **Assignment-02/**
  - Contains the code, report, and assignment document for **Optimizing Performance of Dilated Convolution**.
  - This assignment focuses on optimizing dilated convolution implementations on single-threaded CPU, multi-threaded CPU, and CUDA-based GPU.
  - See the `Assignment-02/README.md` for further details.
